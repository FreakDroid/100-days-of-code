### Day 1: June 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the Sass course and I feel excited.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding on Sass, the course is amazing but my Internet connection is not very good. Today I didn't work on algorithm from hacker rank, because I was focused on the course.


### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: I'm still doing the Sass course.

**Thoughts** I've started to code pretty hard on Sass, I've created the final project for this course although I don't wanna spoil you it's a personal web site. I didn't create a repo for this yet because I'm waiting for move more deep on the course.


### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I decided to back to Hacker Rank, so I took a break of Sass course.

**Thoughts** Today I resolve a problem about code at Hacker Rank (Link bellow), I was doing the 30 days of code challenge, but for work reason I was delayed. So Today I resolved this make me win 30 point there.
